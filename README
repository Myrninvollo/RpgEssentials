Just a heads up for importing into eclipse.

1. Make sure m2e (maven 2 eclipse) is installed
2. Clone project
3. In package explorer, right-click->Import
   a. Select Maven then "Existing Maven Projects" then Next
   b. In Root Directory point to folder to where you cloned RpgEssentials
   Note: Should see all of the projects that currently have pom.xml(s) come up
4. Click finish and wait until maven has pulled down all of the dependencies
5. Enjoy! (The workspace should build automatically)
